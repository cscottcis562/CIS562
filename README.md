I coach youth soccer. I found out the region that I coach for spends 3k annual for a site that tracks the performance and data of the various divisions within the region. This seemed extremely expensive to me. I set out to see how challenging it would be to replicate and possibly enhance the solution they have in place. What I found was that for the most part, what they had was not incredibly sophisticated, but it did require a strong concept of Databases and queries to make the site perform. What I also found was that for what they are paying, they aren't getting what they deserve. It is also very apparent that it is a very simple business model that can be pursued, with the the differtiation point being fuller service options at better price points.  The solution that my region currently uses is found at http://schedule.ayso88.org/division/browse/37  That can be compared with my project at http://proclubs.org/ayso/stathome.php
